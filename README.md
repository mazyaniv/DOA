# DOA
We aim to enhance the MUSIC algorithm for DOA estimation by leveraging the distinct characteristics of mixed-resolution architecture and fitting the covariance matrix R into the algorithm, using Bussgang theorem. 

In addition, we examine deep neural networks for DOA estimation. The code is still being updated occasionally, and the attached PDF only shows some interim results.
