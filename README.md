# DOA
We aim to enhance the MUSIC algorithm for DOA estimation by leveraging the distinct characteristics of mixed-resolution architecture and fitting the covariance matrix R into the algorithm, using Bussgang theorem. 

In addition, we examine deep neural networks for DOA estimation. for more details, see my attached PDF.
